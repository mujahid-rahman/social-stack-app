# Haskell-stack-app

In this individual project I will implemented an Haskell stack app that uses threads and concurrent computation. The task was to simulate a social network that should spawn ten "user" threads, and each of these threads model a user in the social network. The customers should then (at random intervals) choose one of the other users (at random) and send a random message to that user.
