# Haskell-stack-app

During this individual project I implemented a Haskell stack app that uses threads and concurrent computation. The task was to simulate a social network by spawning ten “user” threads, and each of these threads model a user in the social network. The customers should then (at random intervals) choose one of the other users (at random) and send a random message to that user.

As as extentsion I added a feature that allows for chats with multiple users
